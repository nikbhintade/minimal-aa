## Simple Account Abstraction Example

**Chains**
- Ethereum: Worked on creating simple account abstraction example that follows ERC-4337.
- zkSync: Worked with system contract & native account abstraction.

> Use `--system-mode=true` in command while working with zkSync

While working with system contracts if we didn't add the flag then it stays the simulation and if we add the flag compiler does in-line replacements to make sure that our contracts interacts with system contracts.
